        <h1>Privacy Policy for Visitor Magic</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2/26/2025</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>The App collects visitor information entered by the user or retrieved from an external CSV source. However:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No data is stored by the App unless the user explicitly chooses to save visitor information on their own device.</li>
            <li>The App does not transfer, transmit, or share any collected data with the app creator, third parties, or external servers.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>Visitor information is only stored locally on the user’s device when the user chooses to save it.</p>
        <p>The App does not automatically retain visitor data or store information beyond the user’s control.</p>
        <p>The only information retained after closing the App is the address of the stored sheet from which data is fetched.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>The App does not send any collected data to the developer, third parties, or external services.</p>
        <p>All data remains private to the user and is not accessed by anyone outside of the user’s direct control.</p>
        
        <h2>4. User Control</h2>
        <p>Users have full control over the data they input and save.</p>
        <p>Users can delete any stored visitor information at any time through their device.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>Since the App does not transmit or store user data externally, risks related to data breaches or unauthorized access are minimized.</p>
        <p>Users are responsible for securing any stored data on their devices.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted within the App or on the official Visitor Magic website.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>For questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact:</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> visitormagic3@gmail.com</p>
        
        <p>By using Visitor Magic, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>
